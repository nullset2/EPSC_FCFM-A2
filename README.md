Assignment number 2.

Again, be a good boy or girl and don't just freaking copy this shit and present it as your own unless you reaaaaaaally want to go off the deep end in this school.

Hopefully this can help any other people have a nicer experience with this subject --and if you actually made the effort to get here and find it, boy am I glad that you did. You deserve a big pat on the back and a nice panini, with a tall, cold jar of lager beer. Yeah don't you, yeah, I believe you do.
